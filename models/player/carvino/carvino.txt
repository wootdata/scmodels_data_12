Accessory's description	: Not a whole lot to say here.
			  This, my second model, was made purely
			  for the sake of practice, and I still
			  have a long way to go. It isn't really
			  supposed to be anything in particular,
			  but I was playing quite a bit of Nocturne
			  on the side, so the undead mobsters in act
			  three were probably an influence.
			  It's by no means perfect, but I like it.
			  The skin occasionally has some strange
     			  epileptic moments, but a bit of distortion
			  isn't the end of the world.

You know who Half-Life belongs to. The model is mine, all mine. But not the animations.

Feel free to tinker with him, but abuse me, and I'll send a frustrated convict over to teach you why abuse hurts from the inside. M'kay?
